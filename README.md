## Key Features

* **High-Speed Solving**: Implements Kociemba's Two-Phase algorithm to find solutions in under 20 moves, almost instantly.
* **Interactive 3D UI**: A fully interactive 3D cube built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows you to scramble and watch the solution animate.
* **Full-Stack Application**: Built with a Python/Flask backend that serves the application and provides a solver API.
* **Efficient Data Structures**: The solver logic is designed to use pre-computed Pruning Tables for an incredibly fast and efficient search.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This project uses an advanced two-phase algorithm to solve the cube, which is far more efficient than a standard search.

1.  **Phase 1: Solve Orientation**: The algorithm first finds a short sequence of moves to get all corner and edge pieces correctly oriented. It uses a pre-computed **Pruning Table** to know the minimum number of moves required to solve this sub-problem from any state.

2.  **Phase 2: Solve Permutation**: Once the pieces are oriented, the algorithm uses a different set of moves and pruning tables to move the pieces to their final solved positions.

This approach dramatically cuts down the search time, allowing it to find a solution almost instantly.
